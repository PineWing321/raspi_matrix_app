Clarity of thought	9/10	You knew what each line meant and why it was there.
Architecture & structure	9/10	Good abstraction, just one early misstep on planned_runtime init.
Precision	8.5/10	Needed one pass to catch double-count logic, but you caught it yourself.
Execution speed	8/10	You took your timeâ€”and it paid off. Not fast, but deliberate and clean.
Depth of understanding	9.5/10	You reasoned from first principles and took ownership of your model.
