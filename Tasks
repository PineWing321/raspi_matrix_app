Task #1 Week 1. 
ONBOARDING
Document these following steps in a readme, for future devs (more likely me lmao)

WHATS EXPECTED IN THE README FILE:
-document key steps for new devs 
-paste and note key commands and steps 
-document any errors that come up 

Overall task preview
-All dependencies, libraries, and 
-Clone the repo Locally (zip and unzip code)
-Install VS code if not already installed 
-Create python virtual environment 
-install requirements (check requirements.txt) 
-Run the backend (flask run) (not that important)
-Run the frontend(npm start) (not that important)
-confirm the UI loads and connects



THINGS I EXPECT TO HAPPEN
-A missing dependency 
-Virtual env no activated (use source venv/bin/activate)
-pycomm 3 error, simply use pip install pycomm3

Steps:
1. unzip and get this repo locally on your hard drive
2. Install Python 3.10+
3. Install Node.js and npm 
4. install GIT 

Create & activate a virtual env

  macOS/Linux:

  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate


  Windows (PowerShell):

  py -3 -m venv venv
  .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 

Install python deps 
(NOTE, pycomm3 is not in here so you will need to do pip install pycomm3 in terminal)

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

run python app.py, this boots the app up on a local server 

it will likely cause errors IMPORTANT:
document any errors caused up to this point, including error messages
in the terminal and fixes 

ModuleNotFoundError: flask → pip install flask

ModuleNotFoundError: flask_cors → pip install flask-cors

python: command not found → use python3 (mac/Linux) or py (Windows)

virtualenv not active → re-run source venv/bin/activate (mac/Linux) or .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 (Win)

Port already in use → stop previous process or run flask run -p 5001

dotenv/env vars missing → create .env with placeholders you see referenced in code (e.g., FLASK_ENV=development)

SQLite file path / migration errors → look for an init function or first-run script; if missing, a


ENDPOINT: get the app running on the localhost URL and you are good, 
DELIVERABLE: README file completed with whats expected (see top)

IF STUCK: Use chatgpt of course, if in a pickle however shoot me a text


KEYS TO SUCCESS:
-grit, this is the most tedious part of the project, setting up environments 
and navigating the structure will be annoying, but its not intellectually demanding
